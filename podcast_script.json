    "voice": "am_michael",
    "text": "And I'm Michael! Today, we're doing something a little different. Instead of discussing a published paper, we're diving into the resume of Pranav Harshan, an AI enthusiast, to see what cool projects he's been up to!"
  },
  {
    "voice": "af_sarah",
    "text": "That's right, Michael! Think of it as a project showcase turned podcast episode. Pranav seems to have a passion for making AI accessible. What caught your eye first?"
  },
  {
    "voice": "am_michael",
    "text": "Definitely his 'PaperCast-AI' project! It's literally what we're doing right now – turning research papers into engaging podcast conversations. How meta is that?"
  },
  {
    "voice": "af_sarah",
    "text": "Super meta! He built an open-source AI system that uses the Gemini API to extract key insights from papers and then uses Kokoro TTS to generate speech. It even adjusts the podcast length based on the paper's content. It's like a baby version of us!"
  },
  {
    "voice": "am_michael",
    "text": "Exactly! And it's designed to make complex academic topics more accessible, which is our mission too. Speaking of complex, he's also been fine-tuning LLaMA 3.2 for Chain-of-Thought reasoning."
  },
  {
    "voice": "af_sarah",
    "text": "Ah yes, LLaMA! For our listeners who aren't deep in the AI world, LLaMA is a large language model. Chain-of-Thought reasoning is basically getting the AI to explain its thinking process step-by-step, making it more reliable and understandable. He used LoRA and PEFT techniques. Any idea what these are?"
  },
  {
    "voice": "am_michael",
    "text": "LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) are methods to fine-tune large models like LLaMA without needing massive computing power. It's like giving a sports car a tune-up instead of rebuilding the entire engine."
  },
  {
    "voice": "af_sarah",
    "text": "That's a great analogy! He's also worked on a computer vision project for crack detection using YOLO. That's pretty cool, right?"
  },
  {
    "voice": "am_michael",
    "text": "Definitely! YOLO is a real-time object detection system. His project aims to identify cracks in infrastructure images. Think about the applications for that – automatically inspecting bridges or buildings for damage. Super useful!"
  },
  {
    "voice": "af_sarah",
    "text": "And it could save a lot of time and money, not to mention improve safety. He's also built a virtual calculator using hand gestures and the Gemini API! Seems like he's really into human-computer interaction."
  },
  {
    "voice": "am_michael",
    "text": "Yeah, it's a fascinating field. Imagine controlling your computer with just hand movements! He's using computer vision and machine learning to make that a reality. Plus, he's got internships in AWS and MERN stack development, showing a well-rounded skillset."
  },
  {
    "voice": "af_sarah",
    "text": "Absolutely! He's got the cloud, the front-end, the back-end, and a strong focus on AI. Okay, Michael, rapid-fire takeaways! What are the key things we learned from Pranav's resume?"
  },
  {
    "voice": "am_michael",
    "text": "Passion for AI accessibility, hands-on experience with cutting-edge models like LLaMA, practical applications of computer vision, and a solid foundation in full-stack development. This guy is going places!"
  },
  {
    "voice": "af_sarah",
    "text": "Agreed! It's inspiring to see someone so dedicated to making AI more understandable and useful. Thanks for joining us on this slightly different episode, everyone! And Pranav, if you're listening, keep up the amazing work!"
  },
  {
    "voice": "am_michael",
    "text": "Definitely! And to our listeners, what projects are *you* working on? Let us know in the comments! Until next time, keep exploring!"
